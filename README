Approach:
 	1. First creates the RSA public key and c and sends to the server.
	2. Upon receiving those keys, the server brute force cracking the private key.
	3. The server prints the message using the private key.
	4. The client keeps sending requests until it finishes on its own.
 	5. The server never gets shut down by the client, but rather shuts it down on its own.
	
Protocol:
	The client first sends the request as follows:
		Public: 451 c: 2623
	The next time the client sends the request in a following format:
		1184 2123 4124 124 1241

Structures
       Client
	1. Ask the public key and c from the user.
	2. Open the socket using the already open port
	3. Write the request that conforms with the protocol into the socket
	4. After that, encrypt messages using the RSA encryption and send the request to the server
	5. Keep sending until quit is typed.
	6. Close the socket.

       Server
	1. Connect to the socket.
	2. Spawn a thread to listen to the client request.
	3. Receive the public key and c. Then get the private key using a brute force algorithm
	4. Print the cracked message on a console.
	5. Type quit to exit	
	
Code
	Nothing special to mark. Please look at our source code.

Program Usage
	1. Run the server.java
	2. Run the client.java
	3. Type the public key and c for the client.
	4. Type messages for the client.
   	5. Type quit to exit from the client.
	6. Type quit in the server to exit from the server.





** We tested both on our local machine and two different machines **
